# 🍕 PizzaStore (WPF | .NET 8 | EF Core | JWT)

A **modern desktop-based pizza ordering system** built with **WPF (.NET 8)** using **Entity Framework Core** for data access and **JWT Authentication** for secure local login.
Designed with **Clean Architecture (MVVM + Repository Pattern)** — this project demonstrates professional software structure, layered design, and maintainable code practices in desktop applications.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project follows a **multi-layered clean architecture** to separate concerns and maintain scalability:

```
PizzaStore/
│
├── PizzaStore.Domain           → Entities, Models, Core Logic
├── PizzaStore.Infrastructure   → EF Core (DbContext, Repositories, JWT Services)
├── PizzaStore.ApplicationCore  → Services, Interfaces, Business Logic
├── PizzaStore.Presentation     → WPF UI Layer (MVVM: Views, ViewModels, Commands)
│
└── PizzaStore.sln
```

### 🧩 Key Architectural Concepts

* **MVVM Pattern** → Decouples UI (View) from logic (ViewModel)
* **Repository Pattern** → Clean data access using EF Core
* **Dependency Injection** → For maintainable, testable components
* **JWT Authentication** → Secure local authentication (no API required)
* **SQL Server Database** → Persistent local data storage

## 🚀 Features

* 🔑 **User Authentication** (JWT-based local login)
* 🍕 **Pizza Management** (Add, update, delete menu items)
* 🛒 **Order System** (Place and track orders)
* 👤 **Role-based Access** (Admin, Customer)
* 📦 **Persistent Storage** with EF Core & SQL Server

## 💡 Project Use Case

This software simulates a **desktop pizza ordering system** for local use — suitable for:

* Restaurant front-desk ordering
* Desktop POS-style apps
* Student/portfolio projects demonstrating full-stack desktop development

---

## 🧭 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TalhaProgrammer92/PizzaStore
   cd PizzaStore
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio 2022**

3. **Set Startup Project:**

   * Right-click `PizzaStore.Presentation` → *Set as Startup Project*

4. **Update Database:**

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   Press **F5** to build and launch the PizzaStore desktop app 🎉

## 🔐 Authentication (Local JWT)

Even though this is a **desktop-only** app, JWT tokens are used internally for:

* Session management
* Role validation (Admin/Customer)
* Local security simulation

The tokens are generated and validated within the app using local logic (no external API).

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* Follows enterprise-style folder structure
* Implements **SOLID principles**
* Demonstrates **Clean Architecture** in desktop app context
* Great for **portfolios, case studies, or learning advanced .NET**

## 📸 Screenshots

#### 👤 Login UI
I tranformed the login UI from old fashion to a cool modern look. There's two active accounts in my database:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| admin | 12345 | 1 (Admin) |
| customer | customer123 | 0 (User) |

The login UI now looks like this:

![Login Window](/Screenshots/Login%20Window/Login%20window%20-%20ui.png)

#### 🎨 Main Window UI
I created a modern and clean UI of the main window using only XAML, without replying on any third-party libraries/tools. You can take a look:

![Main Window](/Screenshots/Main%20Window/Main%20Window%20-%20UI%20v3.png)

It can be polished even further and I'll add more components like graphs, cards, cart, filters, etc. and all related features for each section.
